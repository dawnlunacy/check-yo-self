    // Object:   A bundle of behavior (methods) and state (properties)
    // Key:   The name used to reference a Value on an Object
    //Value:   The data referenced by a Key
    //Property:   Another word for the ‘Key’ portion of a key-value pair on an object
    //Method:   A function on an Object
    //Dot Notation:   Notation to access a Value on an Object, explicitly specifies the Key
    //Bracket Notation:   Notation to access a Value on an Object, usually specifies a Key via a variable
    //this:  A variable that changes depending on the context in which it’s used
    //class:  A constructor that allows us to create multiple instances
    //instance:   An object of a certain type

//     There are several ways to create an object, and the easiest and most popular is literal notation. The only thing you need in javascript to declare an object is curly braces {}. I swear. Although, it makes things a bit easier if you at least assign it to a variable, like so: var emptyObject = {};

// Objects are a collection of key-value pairs surrounded by curly braces. A key is just a name that holds a value. That sounds familiar, doesn’t it? You’re actually used to working with key-value pairs already, because a key-value pair in an object is essentially a variable. In the context of objects, that variable is called a property of the object. Each property in an object must be unique. You cannot have two properties with the same name. When we assign a function as the value to one of our keys (remember that a function is a tool we use to return a value!), we call that function a method.

// Let’s look at an example:
// var objectName = {
//   property1: value1,
//   property2: value2,
//   method1: function() {
//     return "I'm a method, because I am a function!";
//   }
// };
